# Diseaseprediction

Disease prediction from symptoms.

-> Problem Statement:
	1.Classical diagnosis method is a process where the patient has to visit a doctor, undergo
	various medical test and then come to a conclusion.
	2.This process is very time consuming.

-> Our Solution:
	1.To save the time required and also money for initial process of diagnosis symptoms, this project
	proposes an automated disease prediction sysem that relies on user input.
	2.The system takes input from user and provides a list of probable diseases.

->  More about project:
	1.Disease will be predicted using Naive Bayesian algorithm which works on probabilistic approach
	more specifically Multinomial NB since multiple symptoms are taken.  
	2.According to literature survey, this algorithm results in maximum accuracy for larger dataset.
	3.The dataset contains disease as labels and for each disease symptoms are given.
